## 0.4.0 - 2018-03-15

### Added

- Adds support for zend-expressive-authentication 0.4.0 and up.

### Changed

- [#5](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication-zendauthentication/pull/5)
  changes the constructor of the `Zend\Expressive\Authentication\ZendAuthentication\ZendAuthentication`
  class to accept a callable `$responseFactory` instead of a
  `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` response prototype. The
  `$responseFactory` should produce a `ResponseInterface` implementation when
  invoked.

- [#5](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-expressive-authentication-zendauthentication/pull/5)
  updates the `ZendAuthenticationFactory` to no longer use
  `Zend\Expressive\Authentication\ResponsePrototypeTrait`, and instead always
  depend on the `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface` service to correctly return
  a PHP callable capable of producing a `ResponseInterface` instance.
